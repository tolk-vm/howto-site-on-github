This project shows **a minimal setup** for writing documentation for your github project.

Stored in the same repo **in /docs/ folder**, it is available on *&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;project&gt;*. 

Its content is not plain html/markdown — it is complicated, with same header/footer, variables usage, scss and so on —
but it remains a static site than can be hosted on github pages and easily tested locally.

So, finally it has **no server-side logic**, but client-side is much smarted than just bare html.

All this is done using [**jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/): github pages uses it under the hood.
