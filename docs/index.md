{{ page.demo_local_var }} is focused to show: how to host sites on github, 
but **not just plain html**, but more complex: equal header / footer, markdown and even kind of blog.

This is ideal for project documentation: it is stored in the same repo as the project.

All this is done using **jekyll** — a static site generator. Github pages has jekyll under the hood —
you write md/html code, with tags and includes, test locally, push — and it is published to *github.io*.
